# DIY-Chatbot
> A lightweight chatbot that knows nothing and has to learn from scratch. Using sqlite and python. Also comes with a Discord intergration

## Introduction

### What is this? 

This is a collection of parts from a small chatbot that learns from scratch (knowing nothing at the beginning). There's different pre-made integrations that come with this, such as a Discord Intergration and a Cleverbot Intergration (learns from another bot called cleverbot for extra training). 

If you're just interested in training it in a console, there's that too (and it's really small and lightweight). It's written in Python and uses sqlite. 

### How does it work? 

Coming soon lol 

## Setting up


Set up is very easy and fast. However there's extra steps depending on what you want to do. 

### Basic Setup. 


1. Firstly, *clone the repo or download the zip* (obviously).

2. Next, install the required libaries. You'll mainly need *sqlite3*, which can easily be installed with pip.

```bash
pip install sqlite3
```

3. Go to the Basic Bot folder.

If you want to start from scratch (without the bot knowing anything), simply run the file with no botBrain.sqlite file in the directory.

If you want to start with one of my pretrained models, add it to the Basic Bot folder and name it "botBrain.sqlite". See the README in the models folder or the Basic Bot folder for more info.
